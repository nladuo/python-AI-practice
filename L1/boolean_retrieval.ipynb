I prithee, good Iago,\\n\\tGo to the bay and disembark my coffers:\\n\\tBring thou the master to the citadel;\\n\\tHe is a good one, and his worthiness\\n\\tDoes challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,\\n\\tOnce more, well met at Cyprus.\\n\\n\\t[Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]\\n\\nIAGO\\tDo thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come\\n\\thither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base\\n\\tmen being in love have then a nobility in their\\n\\tnatures more than is native to them--list me. The\\n\\tlieutenant tonight watches on the court of\\n\\tguard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is\\n\\tdirectly in love with him.\\n\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tWith him! why, 'tis not possible.\\n\\nIAGO\\tLay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.\\n\\tMark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,\\n\\tbut for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:\\n\\tand will she love him still for prating? let not\\n\\tthy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;\\n\\tand what delight shall she have to look on the\\n\\tdevil? When the blood is made dull with the act of\\n\\tsport, there should be, again to inflame it and to\\n\\tgive satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,\\n\\tsympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which\\n\\tthe Moor is defective in: now, for want of these\\n\\trequired conveniences, her delicate tenderness will\\n\\tfind itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,\\n\\tdisrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will\\n\\tinstruct her in it and compel her to some second\\n\\tchoice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most\\n\\tpregnant and unforced position--who stands so\\n\\teminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio\\n\\tdoes? a knave very voluble; no further\\n\\tconscionable than in putting on the mere form of\\n\\tcivil and humane seeming, for the better compassing\\n\\tof his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,\\n\\tnone; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a\\n\\tfinder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and\\n\\tcounterfeit advantages, though true advantage never\\n\\tpresent itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the\\n\\tknave is handsome, young, and hath all those\\n\\trequisites in him that folly and green minds look\\n\\tafter: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman\\n\\thath found him already.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tI cannot believe that in her; she's full of\\n\\tmost blessed condition.\\n\\nIAGO\\tBlessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of\\n\\tgrapes: if she had been blessed, she would never\\n\\thave loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou\\n\\tnot see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst\\n\\tnot mark that?\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tYes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.\\n\\nIAGO\\tLechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue\\n\\tto the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met\\n\\tso near with their lips that their breaths embraced\\n\\ttogether. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these\\n\\tmutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes\\n\\tthe master and main exercise, the incorporate\\n\\tconclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I\\n\\thave brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;\\n\\tfor the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows\\n\\tyou not. I'll not be far from you: do you find\\n\\tsome occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking\\n\\ttoo loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what\\n\\tother course you please, which the time shall more\\n\\tfavourably minister.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tWell.\\n\\nIAGO\\tSir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply\\n\\tmay strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for\\n\\teven out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to\\n\\tmutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true\\n\\ttaste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So\\n\\tshall you have a shorter journey to your desires by\\n\\tthe means I shall then have to prefer them; and the\\n\\timpediment most profitably removed, without the\\n\\twhich there were no expectation of our prosperity.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tI will do this, if I can bring it to any\\n\\topportunity.\\n\\nIAGO\\tI warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:\\n\\tI must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.\\n\\nRODERIGO\\tAdieu.\\n\\n\\t[Exit]\\n\\nIAGO\\tThat Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;\\n\\tThat she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:\\n\\tThe Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,\\n\\tIs of a constant, loving, noble nature,\\n\\tAnd I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona\\n\\tA most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;\\n\\tNot out of absolute lust, though peradventure\\n\\tI stand accountant for as great a sin,\\n\\tBut partly led to diet my revenge,\\n\\tFor that I do suspect the lusty Moor\\n\\tHath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof\\n\\tDoth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;\\n\\tAnd nothing can or shall content my soul\\n\\tTill I am even'd with him, wife for wife,\\n\\tOr failing so, yet that I put the Moor\\n\\tAt least into a jealousy so strong\\n\\tThat judgment cannot cure.

Ay, and wisely too;\\n\\tFor 'twould have anger'd any heart alive\\n\\tTo hear the men deny't. So that, I say,\\n\\tHe has borne all things well: and I do think\\n\\tThat had he Duncan's sons under his key--\\n\\tAs, an't please heaven, he shall not--they\\n\\tshould find\\n\\tWhat 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.\\n\\tBut, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd\\n\\tHis presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear\\n\\tMacduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell\\n\\tWhere he bestows himself?\\n\\nLord\\tThe son of Duncan,\\n\\tFrom whom this tyrant holds the due of birth\\n\\tLives in the English court, and is received\\n\\tOf the most pious Edward with such grace\\n\\tThat the malevolence of fortune nothing\\n\\tTakes from his high respect: thither Macduff\\n\\tIs gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid\\n\\tTo wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:\\n\\tThat, by the help of these--with Him above\\n\\tTo ratify the work--we may again\\n\\tGive to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,\\n\\tFree from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,\\n\\tDo faithful homage and receive free honours:\\n\\tAll which we pine for now: and this report\\n\\tHath so exasperate the king that he\\n\\tPrepares for some attempt of war.\\n\\nLENNOX\\tSent he to Macduff?\\n\\nLord\\tHe did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'\\n\\tThe cloudy messenger turns me his back,\\n\\tAnd hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time\\n\\tThat clogs me with this answer.'\\n\\nLENNOX\\tAnd that well might\\n\\tAdvise him to a caution, to hold what distance\\n\\tHis wisdom can provide.

Never Hamlet:\\n\\tIf Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,\\n\\tAnd when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,\\n\\tThen Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.\\n\\tWho does it, then?
